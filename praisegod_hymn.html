    <h2>Praise God, the Lord of Space and Time</h2>
        <p>Praise God, the Lord of space and time,<br>
        Who made the earth and sky,<br>
        The One who set the stars aflame<br>
        And lifted mountains high.<br>
        </p>

        <p>Praise God, who made the tree of life<br>
        And sowed the world with flowers,<br>
        Who formed the beasts and gave them food<br>
        And made all good things ours.<br>
        </p>

        <p>Praise God, the Seeker of the lost<br>
        Who clothed himself in flesh.<br>
        The One named Jesus died for us<br>
        And left all creatures blessed.<br>
        </p>

        <p>Praise Christ, the King, who shall return<br>
        To make creation new.<br>
        The universe will hum with joy<br>
        And trees sing allelu.<br>
        </p>
