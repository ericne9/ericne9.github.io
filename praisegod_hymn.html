            <h2>Praise God, the Lord of Space and Time</h2>
            <p>Praise God, the Lord of space and time,<br>
            Who made the earth and sky,<br>
            The One who set the stars aflame<br>
            And lifted mountains high.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Praise God, who made the tree of life<br>
            And sowed the world with flowers,<br>
            Who formed the beasts and gave them food<br>
            And made all good things ours.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Praise God, the Seeker of the lost<br>
            Who clothed himself in flesh.<br>
            The One named Jesus died for us<br>
            And left all creatures blessed.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Praise Christ, the King, who shall return<br>
            To make creation new.<br>
            The universe will hum with joy<br>
            And trees sing allelu.<br>
            </p>
